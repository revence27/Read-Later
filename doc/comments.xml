It is actually what happens in an atmosphere that is hot and humid but only moderately unstable, on the north edge of a high pressure ridge, with a well-developed northwest flow aloft but not directly under the jet stream.  These situations are generally fairly placid, but they are just stable enough for substantial low-level heat to build up, then when something finally does punch through and go unstable... well, it can set off a chain reaction.  The triggering event is often an otherwise unordinary &amp;quot;mesoscale convective complex,&amp;quot; known to the rest of us as a &amp;quot;clump of thunderstorms.&amp;quot;  The energy lines up just right, and it sets off a cascade much like a string of dominoes toppling.  This sends a self-propagating wave of convection racing towards the east/southeast/south at phenomenal speeds, heralded by a truly spectacular gust front.  It&amp;#39;s not really a large-scale collapse of the system, but a mesoscale process; indeed the large-scale conditions often are much the same over the subsequent days, and another derecho can get set off again if the cards fall right.  They are a relatively recently described phenomenon, but looking back through history they turned out to not be something new at all, just previously unrecognized.  A famous one blasted Memphis a few years back, got dubbed &amp;quot;Hurricane Elvis.&amp;quot;  There are multiple ones most summers, this was not even the first one for 2012 but was definitely stronger than average and hit many big population centers.  June-July is the peak season; they especially like to demolish 4th of July celebrations.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good example of the &amp;quot;who knows what might happen?&amp;quot; aspect of climate change.  The triggering mechanisms for derechos are poorly understood and difficult to forecast, so how can anyone say if they will become more or less frequent?  Extreme events are often balanced on a knife-edge, it is all but impossible to say which way they will be tipped by complex changes.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the major patterns that looks like an early manifestation of CO2-induced climate change that is having major impacts on the northern hemisphere was entirely unpredicted.  The huge jet-stream meanders that usually move ponderously around the planet are getting stuck in place.  These are what cause the shifts between persistent warmth or cold or wet or dry, often lasting for weeks at a time. But now the patterns are locking in place for months at a time, not progressing, causing entire subcontinents to get locked into extremes of temperature and precipitation for very long times.  This caused the &amp;quot;Snowpocalypse&amp;quot; in the northeastern U.S. a couple of winters ago, and is causing the persistent and abnormal warmth in the same region for most of 2012 so far.  And it is causing the persistent cold and damp in the PNW at the same time.  It could easily flip, dumping the eastern U.S. into a suddenly cool late summer and bitter cold winter, and putting the PNW in the furnace.  Or it might not.  The old well-known patterns seem to be fading.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/27481991/2871764972393323229/comments/default/7800444895204487547'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/27481991/2871764972393323229/comments/default/7800444895204487547'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2012/06/cussedness-of-whole-systems.html?showComment=1341289092888#c7800444895204487547' title=''/><author><name>Bill Pulliam</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/02333438671130100114</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='OpenSocialUserId' value='18134320710439670526'/><gd:image xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='24' height='32' src='http://static.flickr.com/60/203285188_3735cd728c.jpg'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2012/06/cussedness-of-whole-systems.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-27481991.post-2871764972393323229' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/27481991/posts/default/2871764972393323229' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-1528267610'/><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='blogger.displayTime' value='7/2/12 9:18 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-27481991.post-8188779414655724292</id><published>2012-07-02T17:33:28.335-07:00</published><updated>2012-07-02T17:33:28.335-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Hi Mark,

Living with an off grid solar power system, you quickly become aware of how inefficient the whole system is. Potential power is lost at every point in the system. It is akin to trying to catch water in a leaky sieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the inefficiencies I experience are nothing compared to the inefficiencies in the grid system. A huge proportion of the electricity generated at a large scale generator is lost to heat and sound even before it gets to the consumer. Transmitting electricity over long distances is a losing game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to your own house, you may be surprised to find that 110v wiring is also inefficient and I&amp;#39;d safely bet that you are losing quite a bit of energy to heat, particularly if you employ large loads such as electrical heating or cooling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chris</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/27481991/2871764972393323229/comments/default/8188779414655724292'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/27481991/2871764972393323229/comments/default/8188779414655724292'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2012/06/cussedness-of-whole-systems.html?showComment=1341275608335#c8188779414655724292' title=''/><author><name>Cherokee Organics</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/06950962122594709186</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='OpenSocialUserId' value='02305632929140779747'/><gd:image xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='21' src='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yPJKR7XD8HA/T0dOryOomyI/AAAAAAAAAAw/tDmetrTeuQg/s220/IMGP4289.JPG'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2012/06/cussedness-of-whole-systems.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-27481991.post-2871764972393323229' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/27481991/posts/default/2871764972393323229' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-1114063069'/><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='blogger.displayTime' value='7/2/12 5:33 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-27481991.post-788239092633918010</id><published>2012-07-02T17:15:48.656-07:00</published><updated>2012-07-02T17:15:48.656-07:00</updated><title type='text'>&amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t think there might actually be ...</title><content type='html'>&amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t think there might actually be something to this global warming stuff, do you?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- brilliant, sounds like the caption to a classic cartoon from Punch or the New Yorker.

I&amp;#39;ll go looking for one shortly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SeaMari, if I had a meadow, I&amp;#39;d want a scythe, too, but in my case it&amp;#39;s a matter of keeping weeds in check in an old driveway with lots of broken concrete, and other environments where you wouldn&amp;#39;t want to risk a scythe blade. (I&amp;#39;m almost tempted to sing: &amp;quot;If I had a meadow, I&amp;#39;d scythe it in the mo-or-ning...&amp;quot;) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GS, thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kurt, many thanks for the description.  This sort of thing is exactly why those of us who are aware of the shape of the future ahead of us need to start learning the skills and acquiring the tools that will make life viable in a deindustrial society. Correct me if I&amp;#39;m wrong, but I believe Annapolis was a thriving town in the days before air conditioning and electric fans, right? If people like you start learning how to live comfortably in summer in your location without a/c and electric fans, you&amp;#39;re going to be much better prepared for a future where grid electricity is going to be increasingly intermittent -- that is, of course, before it goes away altogether. You&amp;#39;re also going to be able to help other people make that change, of course. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Renaissance, excellent! You get today&amp;#39;s gold star. The collapse of the Soviet Union was in fact a classic self-limiting catabolic collapse; as you point out, they didn&amp;#39;t revert to a deindustrial society. Russia underwent a sharp decline, then stabilized and have even had a modest upswing in recent years, just as the catabolic collapse model predicts. The next round of collapse will hit them in due time--just as it will hit us, of course.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/27481991/2871764972393323229/comments/default/5185294909806870656'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/27481991/2871764972393323229/comments/default/5185294909806870656'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2012/06/cussedness-of-whole-systems.html?showComment=1341272083645#c5185294909806870656' title=''/><author><name>John Michael Greer</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/04737693388485635100</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='22' height='32' src='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_l8lHlfw_Vps/TNL9uXoNBwI/AAAAAAAAABA/gr9jJgKhTxA/S220/JMG1.jpg'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2012/06/cussedness-of-whole-systems.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-27481991.post-2871764972393323229' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/27481991/posts/default/2871764972393323229' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-64504449'/><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='blogger.displayTime' value='7/2/12 4:34 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-27481991.post-6852631288347773701</id><published>2012-07-02T13:54:35.524-07:00</published><updated>2012-07-02T13:54:35.524-07:00</updated><title type='text'>OK, I&amp;#39;ve had time to digest and think deeper a...</title><content type='html'>OK, I&amp;#39;ve had time to digest and think deeper and realize: of course! -- this lies at the core of the idea you describe in Catabolic Collapse.&lt;br /&gt;This would be why civilizations, when they recover temporarily from some disruptive shock, tend to try and re-create the same form that they had before the shock-of-loss. The form is as close as they can make it, but, because it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; so close in form, it still requires more resources than is really available, setting things up for the next shock/decline step. It&amp;#39;s about psychological comfort driving a systemic behaviour, as human society is itself a system.&lt;br /&gt;As for Bardi and the Seneca Cliff, how would you compare that theory against the actual sharp decline experienced during the last years of the Soviet Union? Because that decline looked a lot like Seneca&amp;#39;s Cliff to me.&lt;br /&gt;Or would you say that it was more of a sharp step down, as they didn&amp;#39;t actually decline into a post-industrial society, given that they maintained the form of government and maintained things such as transit, elecricty, &amp;amp;c. and &amp;#39;came to rest&amp;#39; on a new plateau as it were?</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/27481991/2871764972393323229/comments/default/6852631288347773701'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/27481991/2871764972393323229/comments/default/6852631288347773701'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2012/06/cussedness-of-whole-systems.html?showComment=1341262475524#c6852631288347773701' title=''/><author><name>Renaissance Man</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/00354231084028659509</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='OpenSocialUserId' value='09858413784126074733'/><gd:image xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='23' height='32' src='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-oIwp-n2BaFs/T2OTNhJQGZI/AAAAAAAAAAU/dLCBDCOas4U/s220/Image1.jpg'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2012/06/cussedness-of-whole-systems.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-27481991.post-2871764972393323229' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/27481991/posts/default/2871764972393323229' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-1886612313'/><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='blogger.displayTime' value='7/2/12 1:54 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-27481991.post-6208725967390273884</id><published>2012-07-02T13:29:56.694-07:00</published><updated>2012-07-02T13:29:56.694-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Tim

Given...</title><content type='html'>JMG - Glad to hear you survived the Derecho. Given the topic of systems from you post, I found the storm a classic example of a system at work that could prove very destructive long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Mexico, there&amp;#39;s a very tight circulating high that has been sitting there for about a week and will be sitting there another week easily. To the north of that there&amp;#39;s another high circulating in the opposite direction feeding the hot dry air of Mexico into a loop centered over Colorado, which at this point is an open, fiery oven. Above this is the jet stream, which is pushing this oven in the other direction like a circular gear on alternatively moving gear trains. The Jet Stream picks up that heat and lets it build up just west of Chicago, with the cold wet atmosphere of Lake Michigan acting like a giant wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last Friday, the dome of hot dry air eventually breached this wall, and came rushing down a pressurized trough towards Washington DC at more than 80 miles an hour. The resulting Derecho, or Land Hurricane, created a swath of devastation across much of Maryland and DC, felling trees, dropping power lines, and frying transformers already straining against the 100F+ degree heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For many of us in that region, we got a cold hard taste of what&amp;#39;s coming in the 21st century. I&amp;#39;m from the Pacific Northwest, which is currently experiencing Junuary - temperatures more consistent with March than late June. Air conditioning is pretty much required, though usually most heavily towards the latter part of July, but even without AC, fans can at least help to cool things somewhat. Without electricity, there were no fans, and the two story house we rent became unliveable. You cannot store food, because there is no power to the refrigerators, you cannot cook food, because there is no power to the stove. Houses in the area were designed with air conditioning in mind (at least those post 1980) - these became stifling ovens in triple digit temperatures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Derecho caused a massive power surge in the system because of all of the AC being used, and then compounded this with damage to overhead wires. We were fortunate to get power back in three days - others may wait more than a week. Most of the supermarkets in the area were throwing out all of their perishables - likely several billion dollars in food that depend upon the miracle of freezers. Gas stations started running out of gasoline as everyone stocked up for generators or to insure that they had gas to get away if necessary, and batteries and water became scarce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What many people, even those who follow the peak oil movement closely, frequently fail to recognize is the degree to which we are dependent upon reliable energy. We have few ways of storing or preparing feed that doesn&amp;#39;t require a power cord of some sort, we lose contact with one another very quickly, we can&amp;#39;t even count on the water being safe to drink (the sewage treatment plant&amp;#39;s power failed and it was running on generators - when energy ran out for those generators (two to three more days), people would be dealing with sewage tainted water, and cholera would become a real problem again. The storm ended up with a couple dozen casualties, but these didn&amp;#39;t account for poor seniors who died of heart attacks and strokes induced by heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The morning after the first storm, people flocked to one of the few coffeeshops that still had power, desperate for caffeine and news in that order. Annapolis tends to be a weird mix of poor black Democrats and upper crust white yachtsmen Republicans, and two of the latter were sipping coffee and staring out at the heat coming off the concrete amidst the downed trees, when I heard one say to the other &amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t think there might actually be something to this global warming stuff, do you?&amp;quot;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/27481991/2871764972393323229/comments/default/5840897028496467025'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/27481991/2871764972393323229/comments/default/5840897028496467025'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2012/06/cussedness-of-whole-systems.html?showComment=1341249307925#c5840897028496467025' title=''/><author><name>Kurt Cagle</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/11746604103523406806</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='OpenSocialUserId' value='05105338892996423068'/><gd:image xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='24' height='32' src='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_b5b0IZITKSM/SgMcI-iIU-I/AAAAAAAAAWo/sMg6e0pefGI/S220/KurtCaglePortrait_Web.png'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2012/06/cussedness-of-whole-systems.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-27481991.post-2871764972393323229' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/27481991/posts/default/2871764972393323229' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-245956293'/><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='blogger.displayTime' value='7/2/12 10:15 AM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-27481991.post-1995526695639768273</id><published>2012-07-02T07:12:36.820-07:00</published><updated>2012-07-02T07:12:36.820-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Mark -- True that biology has not seemed to have a...</title><content type='html'>Mark -- True that biology has not seemed to have any need for bulk electric current, getting everything done with electrochemical potentials and current flows only on a microscopic scale.  But of course a lot of what we do with electricity is to use it to produce torque, heat, and light -- all things that biology accomplishes without it.  The roadrunner runs, the hummingbird flies, and the tuna swims, all driven by electron transfer on a molecular scale.  We heat our bodies and fireflies flash their signal lights using the same method.  One wonders if the system we use, of converting wind and hydrostatic pressure into electricity, then transmitting it long distances, where it is reconverted to torque, heat, and light, is really a good bet in the big picture.  Might it not turn out that in the end (after the salvage economy runs it course) we&amp;#39;ll get light, heat, and torque through biology again (i.e. biological fuels and muscles)?

But I would add one caveat.  When humans try to engineer something that nature has never had any reason to design, then all bets are off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not surprisingly, human attempts to convert sunlight into chemical energy haven&amp;#39;t gotten much higher than the ~6-10% maximum efficiency of photosynthesis.  However, living bodies have no need of electricity (aside from small electrical potentials in cells and nerves), so evolution hasn&amp;#39;t really explored possible ways of making it.  Thus I wouldn&amp;#39;t conclude that just because no other organism uses hydropower or wind power for energy that these technologies are fundamentally incompatible with the biosphere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With regard to Oregon climate, we are subject to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which cycles between warm and cold phases on the scale of 20-30 years.  While recent springs and summers have been cool relative to the past 20 years, they are on par with the last cold PDO phase from the 1950s to the 1970s.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may be that climate change is going to bring cooler springs/summers to Oregon, or it may be that we won&amp;#39;t really see the effects until the PDO warms and the summers are hotter than any on record.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/27481991/2871764972393323229/comments/default/8883128512352300150'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/27481991/2871764972393323229/comments/default/8883128512352300150'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2012/06/cussedness-of-whole-systems.html?showComment=1341199179712#c8883128512352300150' title=''/><author><name>Mark Luterra</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/13944107889861543617</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2012/06/cussedness-of-whole-systems.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-27481991.post-2871764972393323229' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/27481991/posts/default/2871764972393323229' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-1935985890'/><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='blogger.displayTime' value='7/1/12 8:19 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-27481991.post-1855769467819437224</id><published>2012-07-01T19:53:57.130-07:00</published><updated>2012-07-01T19:53:57.130-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Hi Bill Pulliam,

The reason for this is that evolution can only &amp;quot;pursue goals&amp;quot; (to anthropomorphise a bit) that are advantageous every step of the way. &lt;br /&gt;Say, for example, that nuclear fusion was possible but that every interim step to evolve it representated a competitive disavantage to the organism. If this was the case then it would never evolve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I&amp;#39;m more convinced by those who claim that photosynthesis is the best (whole lifecycle) way to turn the sun&amp;#39;s light into chemical energy (eg. better than solar PV, once one considers cost of manufacture, distribution, installation, maintenance, etc). Time to plant a woodlot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/27481991/2871764972393323229/comments/default/1855769467819437224'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/27481991/2871764972393323229/comments/default/1855769467819437224'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2012/06/cussedness-of-whole-systems.html?showComment=1341197637130#c1855769467819437224' title=''/><author><name>wall0159</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/09061847081214647506</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2012/06/cussedness-of-whole-systems.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-27481991.post-2871764972393323229' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/27481991/posts/default/2871764972393323229' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-1933386989'/><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='blogger.displayTime' value='7/1/12 7:53 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-27481991.post-550967829556311125</id><published>2012-07-01T18:13:22.258-07:00</published><updated>2012-07-01T18:13:22.258-07:00</updated><title type='text'>FWIW - I have used a grass whip (&amp;quot;human power...</title><content type='html'>FWIW - I have used a grass whip (&amp;quot;human powered weed whacker&amp;quot;), as well as gas powered string trimmers, and much prefer an Austrian-style scythe fitted with a 24&amp;quot; - 26&amp;quot; bush blade to both of those tools for weed/grass control and cutting paths through the meadow.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/27481991/2871764972393323229/comments/default/550967829556311125'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/27481991/2871764972393323229/comments/default/550967829556311125'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2012/06/cussedness-of-whole-systems.html?showComment=1341191602258#c550967829556311125' title=''/><author><name>SeaMari</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01860689994842664250</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2012/06/cussedness-of-whole-systems.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-27481991.post-2871764972393323229' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/27481991/posts/default/2871764972393323229' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-652021467'/><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='blogger.displayTime' value='7/1/12 6:13 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-27481991.post-8600435737340859585</id><published>2012-07-01T17:11:37.319-07:00</published><updated>2012-07-01T17:11:37.319-07:00</updated><title type='text'>You can get grass whips at your local Tractor Supp...</title><content type='html'>You can get grass whips at your local Tractor Supply, or on Amazon.com, or at farm yard sales.

Even though &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinococcus_radiodurans" rel="nofollow"&gt;Deinococcus radiodurans&lt;/a&gt; can endure the rigors of a nuclear reactor, it does not derive any benefit from it.

And, unfortunately, I&amp;#39;m one of those 300 million that continues to use it every day.....</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/27481991/2871764972393323229/comments/default/5481763726942939622'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/27481991/2871764972393323229/comments/default/5481763726942939622'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2012/06/cussedness-of-whole-systems.html?showComment=1341164878299#c5481763726942939622' title=''/><author><name>Steve W.</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/10185017445834278449</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='28' height='32' src='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jc4_rGWsX64/TjSfO6WVLWI/AAAAAAAAADM/cBXs1f3AuXA/s220/tiny-house.jpeg'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2012/06/cussedness-of-whole-systems.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-27481991.post-2871764972393323229' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/27481991/posts/default/2871764972393323229' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-1732711142'/><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='blogger.displayTime' value='7/1/12 10:47 AM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-27481991.post-9008658637439004066</id><published>2012-07-01T10:40:47.159-07:00</published><updated>2012-07-01T10:40:47.159-07:00</updated><title type='text'>&amp;quot;Human powered weed wackers&amp;quot; are otherwi...</title><content type='html'>&amp;quot;Human powered weed wackers&amp;quot; are otherwise known as grass whips (as in you whip the thing back and forth to cut the grass)  Familiar with them from needing to cut the grass around the electric fences in my youth on the farm.

A large number of the 26,000+ students and 11,000+ employees currently in the area will be seeking other jobs or bailing out of the academic life they now enjoy (and the area). Billions of dollars now supporting services and businesses could go poof overnight. It may be better to establish one&amp;#39;s self in an area already bottoming out.

Why &amp;quot;cruise&amp;quot; the neighborhood picking up friends when one can just text them or say hi to them on Facebook? Another reason, and this is my own conjecture, is that driving just isn&amp;#39;t much fun anymore with traffic congestion in the suburbs the way it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John, I was musing about your initial thoughts here--the fact that Hubbert&amp;#39;s bell curve isn&amp;#39;t behaving the way peak oilers have thought it would--and was wondering if the &amp;quot;liquid fuels&amp;quot; statistics are gross or net? In other words, do they account for the (increasing) need to input more liquid fuels in order to extract the same volume as before? (As you have noted, it takes a lot of energy input to turn those tar sands into refineable crude.) If they aren&amp;#39;t, and if we subtracted the actual energy cost on energy production, we might be observing a net decline in fuel production, and therefore we might already be on the downslope of Hubbert&amp;#39;s curve. Just a thought.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/27481991/2871764972393323229/comments/default/7900839746477185690'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/27481991/2871764972393323229/comments/default/7900839746477185690'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2012/06/cussedness-of-whole-systems.html?showComment=1341155159026#c7900839746477185690' title=''/><author><name>Don Plummer</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/11970765107980643386</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='OpenSocialUserId' value='06271179038422568937'/><gd:image xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tevflhCviUg/TcWdy5r8fHI/AAAAAAAAACU/ICXE65gHVlc/s220/Highbanks%2BTrilliums.jpg'/></author><thr:in-reply-to xmlns:thr='http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0' href='http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2012/06/cussedness-of-whole-systems.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-27481991.post-2871764972393323229' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/27481991/posts/default/2871764972393323229' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-396072150'/><gd:extendedProperty xmlns:gd='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005' name='blogger.displayTime' value='7/1/12 8:05 AM'/></entry></feed>
